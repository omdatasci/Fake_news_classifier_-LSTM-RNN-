# Fake_news_classifier_-LSTM-RNN-
This project implements a Fake News Classifier using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with TensorFlow and Keras.

The model aims to detect fake news with high accuracy by leveraging advanced preprocessing techniques and embedding layers for effective text representation.

**Key Features**
- **Preprocessing**: Incorporated text preprocessing techniques like Porter Stemmer for word normalization and removal of stopwords to enhance the modelâ€™s learning efficiency.
- **One-hot Encoding**: Converted textual data into one-hot representations for better handling by the neural network.
- **Embedding & Padding**: Utilized embedding layers and applied sequence padding to manage variable-length input data, ensuring a uniform input size for the LSTM.
- **Model Performance**: Achieved an accuracy of 90%, providing reliable predictions on news authenticity.
